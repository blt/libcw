### Example Programs
#### The Imp
The Imp is a simple program that just copies itself forward one address forever
```
MOV 0, 1
```

```
# Tick 0
    ...
    MOV 0, 1 <--- PC
    ...      <--- Target

# Tick 1
    ...
    MOV 0, 1 
    MOV 0, 1 <--- PC
    ...      <--- Target
```

#### The Dwarf
The Dwarf *bombs* the core at regular intervals, but if the coresize is a
multiple of 4, it will not bomb itself

```
    ADD #4, 3
    MOV 2, @2
    JMP -2
    DAT #0, #0
```

```
# Tick 0
    ...
    ADD #4, 3   <--- PC
    MOV 2, @2
    JMP -2
    DAT #0, #0  <--- Target
    ...

# Tick 1
    ...
    ADD #4, 3
    MOV 2, @2   <--- PC
    JMP -2
    DAT #0, #4  <--- Target
    ...
    ...
    ...
    Dat #0, #4  <--- Indirect target
    ...
# Tick 2
    ...
    ADD #4, 3   <--- Target
    MOV 2, @2   
    JMP -2      <--- PC
    DAT #0, #4  
    ...
    ...
    ...
    Dat #0, #4  
    ...
```
